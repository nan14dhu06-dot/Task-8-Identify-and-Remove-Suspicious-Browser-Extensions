# Task 8 – VPN Setup & Privacy Lab

This task is part of the *Cyber Security Internship – Task 8: Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions*.  
The focus here is on understanding how *VPNs (Virtual Private Networks)* protect privacy and secure communication.

---

## Objective

- Understand the role of VPNs in protecting online privacy and securing data in transit.  
- Learn how to install, configure, and use a free VPN client.  
- Observe how a VPN changes your IP address and affects browsing.  
- Summarise the benefits and limitations of VPNs.

---

## Tools Used

- *VPN Client:* ProtonVPN Free / Windscribe Free (or any reputable free VPN)
- *OS:* Windows / Linux / macOS  
- *Browser:* Chrome / Firefox / Edge  
- *IP Check Website:* https://www.whatismyipaddress.com

---

## Steps Performed

1. Selected a reputable free VPN service and created an account.  
2. Downloaded and installed the VPN client on the system.  
3. Connected to a VPN server (e.g., Netherlands / closest region).  
4. Visited whatismyipaddress.com and recorded IP and location.  
5. Browsed a few websites to confirm traffic works over VPN.  
6. Disconnected the VPN and checked the IP and location again.  
7. Compared speed and behaviour with and without VPN.  
8. Researched VPN encryption, tunnelling protocols, and privacy features.  
9. Wrote a short summary on VPN benefits, limitations, and security use-cases.


## Key Observations

- Public IP and geolocation changed when VPN was connected.  
- Traffic remained functional but slightly slower due to encryption.  
- After disconnection, IP reverted to the original ISP-assigned address.  

Screenshots included in this repo:

- screenshot2_vpn_connected.png – VPN connected to remote server  
- screenshot3_ip_with_vpn.png – IP page with VPN enabled  
- screenshot4_ip_without_vpn.png – IP page after disconnecting VPN  

## Conclusion

This task provided practical experience with VPN setup and verification.  
It demonstrated how VPNs hide the real IP address, encrypt traffic, and support safer browsing and security testing, while also showing that VPNs have performance impacts and cannot solve all security or privacy problems alone.
